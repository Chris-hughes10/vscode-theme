# chris-simple-python-theme README

A theme for VScode which doesn't use too many colours. This is more for my own benefit than for public use ;)

## Add your extension to Visual Studio Code

Copy the extension folder to the extension directory. This is:

- on Windows %USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions

- on Mac/Linux $HOME/.vscode/extensions

Restart VSCode and select the new theme in File -> Preferences -> Color Theme
